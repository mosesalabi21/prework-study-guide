# PreWork Study Guide Webpage

## This is a Prework and Beginner Learning Manual Into Developing A Web page

The motivation behind the Guide is to have a simple yet detailed explanation on how to set up a fit for purpose webpage.
The guide will give information on how to effectively put together the components for a webpage, and also ways to over come issues that may arise.
The project was build to give experiences using all the tools and codes needed for development, and also so it can be referred back to at later times as a guide if needed.
I've learned the tools needed to start a webpage and the correct setup in which is needed to make the site preform and visually make sense to the reader.
